/*
Assume "#" is like a backspace in string. This means that string "a#bc#d" actually is "bd"

Your task is to process a string with "#" symbols.

Examples
"abc#d##c"      ==>  "ac"
"abc##d######"  ==>  ""
"#######"       ==>  ""
""              ==>  ""

function cleanString(s) {
    return s.split('').reduce((acc,c)=> c === '#' ? acc.substr(0,acc.length-1) : acc += c, '')
}
