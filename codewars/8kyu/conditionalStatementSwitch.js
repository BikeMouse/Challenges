/*
witch is the keyword and n is the variable to switch. case 1 means when n===1. Following the ":" you can add your code for what to do in that case. The keyword break is used as termination - if you forget break, the code will continue running through the other case statements and default until a break appears. If no case statements match, default is entered.

In some instances, the switch statement is clearer than the if..else statement.
