# Challenges

## Daily coding challenges


### About
Every day I am testing myself with a coding challenge, implementing what I have learned.

### How It Is Done
Tech used: JavaScript

During each Challenge, I am conducting PREP - some of the files in the repo will have that as comments - and then go on to solve the task

### Lessons Learned
At the beginning of my daily challenges, I had conducted without PREP, which would lead me loosing sight of what is needing done. Over time and with practice, PREP had become second nature to me.
